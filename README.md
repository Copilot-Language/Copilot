# Copilot: a stream DSL
Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
approach.

Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
for systems with hard realtime requirements.


# Installation
There are two ways to install Copilot:

* From Hackage (Recommended way):

  The Copilot library is cabalized. Assuming you have cabal and the GHC
  compiler installed (the
  [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) is the easiest way
  to obtain these), it should merely be a matter of running

      cabal install copilot

  with an Internet connection.

* Building from source from the GitHub repositories, typically one would only
  go this route to develop Copilot.

      git clone https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot.git
      cd Copilot
      git submodule update --remote
      make

Note there is a TravisCI build (linked to at the top of this README) if you
have trouble building/installing.
