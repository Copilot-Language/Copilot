    | BadType Var Var -- ^ either a variable is not defined, or not with the good type ; there is no implicit conversion of types in /Copilot/
    | NonNegativeWeightedClosedPath [Var] Weight -- ^ The algorithm to compile /Copilot/ specification can only work if there is no negative weighted closed path in the specification, as described in the original research paper
    | DependsOnClosePast [Var] Var Weight Weight -- ^ Could be compiled, but would need bigger prophecyArrays
    | DependsOnFuture [Var] Var Weight-- ^ If an output depends of a future of an input it will be hard to compile to say the least
