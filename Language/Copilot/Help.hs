  , "USAGE:"
  , "There are 4 essential Copilot commands.  Each command may take a variety"
  , "of options. We describe the commands then list the possible options."
  , ""
  , " interpret :: Streams -> Int -> (Options -> Options) -> IO ()"
  , " > interpret STREAMS RNDS (noOpts | [$ OPTS])"
  , "   Executes the interpreter for the Copilot specification STREAMS of type"
  , "   'Streams', where the specification is interpreted as a set of mutually-"
  , "   recursive Haskell infinite lists.  The output from the lists is given"
  , "   for RNDS indexes.  RNDS must be greater than 0."
  , ""
  , " compile :: Streams -> String -> (Options -> Options) -> IO ()"
  , " > compile STREAMS FILENAME (noOpts | [$ OPTS])"
  , "   Compiles the Copilot specification STREAMS to constant-time & constant-"
  , "   constant-space C program named FILENAME.c with header FILENAME.h"
  , "   and executable FILENAME."
  , ""
  , " > test RNDS (noOpts | [$ OPTS])"
  , "   Generates a random set of streams & inputs for external variables, and"
  , "   tests the equivalence between the output of the compiled C program and"
  , "   the interpreter over RNDS rounds.  RNDS must be greater than 0.  This"
  , "   command is equivalent to executing the interpret command and the"
  , "   compile command for a randomly-generated stream and comparing the"
  , "   results by-hand.  Throws an error if the outputs differ.  Testing"
  , "   external arrays is currently not supported."

  , " > STREAMS                                   -- in ghci"
  , "   Pretty-prints the parsed Copilot specification of type 'Streams'."
  , ""
  , " verify :: FilePath -> Int -> String -> IO () (FilePath is a synonym for String)"
  , " > verify PATH/FILE.c n opts (opts are additional options for cbmc.)"
  , "   Calls cbmc, developed by Daniel Kroening \& Edmund Clarke"
  , "   <http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/> on a C file generated by Copilot."
  , "   cbmc is a bounded model-checker that verifies C programs.  While there"
  , "   should be no incorrect C programs generated by the Copilot compiler,"
  , "   cbmc provides independent evidence of this claim.  Specifically, it"
  , "   checks that there are no buffer overflows (both lower and upper), that"
  , "   there are no pointer deferences of NULL, that there is no division by"
  , "   zero, that floating point computations do not result in not-a-number"
  , "   (NaN), and that no uninitialized local variables are used.  The entry"
  , "   point of main() is assumed, and it is also assumed that main() can be"
  , "   unrolled at least n times, where n is an Int.  This command is thus"
  , "   best used when generating a simulation program (see the setSim option)."  
  , "   For more information on the properties checked, see"
