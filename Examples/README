This directory contains a number of examples.  They show off various aspects of
the language and various backends, including compiling through the Atom (C99)
backend, SBV backend, interpreting, and generating driver to model-check the two
back-ends against each other (in Examples).  The libraries are in the
copilot-libraries package.

 * AddMult: demonstrates Haskell-level recursion

 * Array: external arrays

 * BadExtVars: demonstrates the analyzer catches badly-typed external variables

 * Cast: demonstrates type-safe casting

 * ClockExamples: demonstrates the use of clocks (to control sampling rates)

 * EngineExample: simple engine temperature monitor example

 * Examples: a large number of small examples

 * Examples2: more small examples

 * ExtFuns: sampling external functions

 * Local: using local variables (let expressions inside of Copilot)

 * LTLExamples: demonstrates the bounded LTL library

 * PTLTLExamples: demonstrates the past-time LTL library

 * Random: how to generate a random specification for QuickCheck-type testing
   (use the copilot-c99-qc executable to run QuickCheck tests against the Atom
   backend).

 * RegExpExamples: demonstrates the regular expressions library

 * StackExamples: demonstrates the stack library

 * StatExamples: demonstrates the statistics library

 * VotingExamples: demonstrates the fault-tolerant voting library
