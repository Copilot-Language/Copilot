Copilot: A (Haskell DSL) stream language for generating hard real-time C code.

Can you write a list in Haskell? Then you can write embedded C code using
Copilot. Here's a Copilot program that computes the Fibonacci sequence (over
Word 64s) and tests for even numbers:


fib :: Streams
fib = do
  "fib" .= [0,1] ++ var "fib" + (drop 1 $ varW64 "fib")
  "t" .= even (var "fib")
    where even :: Spec Word64 -> Spec Bool
          even w = w `mod` const 2 == const 0    

Copilot contains an interpreter, a compiler, and uses a model-checker to check
the correctness of your program. The compiler generates constant time and
constant space C code via Tom Hawkin's Atom (thanks Tom!). Copilot was
originally developed to write embedded monitors for more complex embedded
systems, but it can be used to develop a variety of functional-style embedded
code.
