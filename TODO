TODOs

* Modify atom so that it refuses names that produce invalid C code. See
   checkname in Language.Atom.Elaboration.hs (still probably bugged) Also see
   normalizeVar in Language.Copilot.Core.hs.

 * Add arrays to the language(?)

 * Do MC/DC coverage testing(?)
   * Use the open-source Certification thing?

 * AIG-based equivalence checking.

 * Add math.h functions to Language.hs.

* Move all the error-checking to one file, instead of "error ..." spread all
   over.

 * Better error handling/error message for bad options/parameters for interface
   functions.  Perhaps use hsTidy?  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hstidy>

 * Use para <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/para> for pretty-formatting
   error msgs from Analyzer.hs as well as Help.hs.
 
 * Go through using hlint suggestions.

 * Add to Help.hs documentation on using the setClock function to use the HW
   clock.

 * Fix splint warnings on generated C code 

 * Libs/Indexes return a parameterized type rather than Int16

 * Display external vars when interpreting
