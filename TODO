TODOs

 * cabal build/install throws lots of warnings
  
 * Interrupts in Atom
   * And can be called from Copilot

 * Modify atom so that it refuses names that produce invalid C code. See
   checkname in Language.Atom.Elaboration.hs (still probably bugged) Also see
   normalizeVar in Language.Copilot.Core.hs.

 * Add arrays to the language(?)

 * Do MC/DC coverage testing(?)
